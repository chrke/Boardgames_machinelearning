Board games have been making a comeback lately, and deeper, more strategic boardgames, like Settlers of Catan have become hugely popular. A popular site where these types of board games are discussed and reviewed is BoardGameGeek. The dataset for this project contains 80000 board games and their associated review scores. The data was scraped from BoardGameGeek and compiled into CSV format by Sean Beck.

This project was done as a part of my datascience learning on www.dataquest.io
